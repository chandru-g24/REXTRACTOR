# What is Rextractor?
We are currently working as intern in [Microbiological Laboratory Research and Services](https://microserv.in/) in association of [Microbiological Laboratory](https://microlabindia.com/).
**Rextractor** is a dedicated application crafted to aid users of the Rotor-Gene PCR cycler in the extraction of raw data from ".rex" files generated by the Rotor-Gene Q-Rex Software Series. Rextractor utilizes a novel **algorithm** for extracting HRM and Amplification data from .rex files. This is notable because, thus far, there has been a lack of standalone software capable of converting .rex file formats into Excel file formats without the depedency of proprietary software(Rotor Gene Q rex Software).

# Need for Rextractor
In a [Microbiological laboratory](https://microlabindia.com/), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a vital tool used to test patient samples for various pathogens and genetic markers. The laboratory utilizes different PCR machines such as [Rotor Gene Q Rex software](https://www.qiagen.com/zh-us), [BIO-RAD'S CFX SERIES](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-in/product/cfx-connect-real-time-pcr-detection-system?ID=LN5TFG15), [THERMO FISHER](https://www.thermofisher.com/in/en/home.html) and more. Diving deeper into the Rotor Gene Q Rex software, upon inputting test samples, it generates output in the form of .rex files (Rex Experiment files). Until now, the exclusive means of analyzing these test samples has been through the Rotor Gene Q Rex software. Previous projects also relied on the Rotor Gene software due to its automated workflow environment.However, our current project aims to address these limitations by parsing .rex files.

  <b>Manual Conversion</b> <br/>
  The manual conversion process for each .rex file to .xls format took <strong>more than one minute</strong>, resulting in significant time consumption and an overly lengthy process.

<p align="center">
  <b>Conversion Through Rextractor</b> <br/>
  Rextractor efficiently extracts raw data from .rex files to .xlsx format in less than a second. It processes hundreds of .rex files in <strong>less than one minute</strong>
